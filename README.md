### Hi there 👋

I'm Nicolás and this is my repository!

I work as a Developer at Baufest, my interests are Software and Web Depeveloment. 💻 
This year I finished the System Analist career (a pre-grade IT career of 3 years of duration).✔️
After of that, I wanted to still learning so I joined the Platzi community (an educative online platform about technology) 🚀
I'm currently doing the Coursera's Angular course to keep growing in my current job. 👓
Besides technology I love to learn new things, specially those which make your life more meaningful and increase your productivity. 📈
I love to read about personal development, philosophy, theology and inspirational stories. 📚
In my free time I like to play the guitar and sing (even though people say I'm not good at it haha). 🎻
